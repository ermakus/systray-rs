# SYSTRAY-RS IS ALIVE

systray-rs is now deprecated. I had some hopes about working on this, but I really am just not finding any intersection between this project and other projects I'm maintaining, so I think it's best to call it done then having everyone hold out for my updates that will most likely never arrive.

To anyone who wants to fork: You can, but I would really recommend against it. Use this repo as reference if you want to, but most of this code was written in 2016, when I was very new to Rust. It doesn't handle cross-platform GUI needs well at all.

If you're going to build your own version of this: Great! If/when you finish it, get in touch and I'll add a link here. But a word of advice: You really do not want to tackle this from the perspective of "Oh I'll do it on [insert prefered OS here] then other people will contribute other platforms". You need to plan for Win/macOS/Linux at the same time or you will end up with an unworkable mess. There are systray implementations in other languages (some of which are listed in the issues here), I'd definitely recommend cribbing from those, much as I tried to crib this one from Go.

I'm going to leave the issues and PRs up since they may also contain relevant reference info for whoever decides to take this on next.

Good luck.

systray-rs is a Rust library that makes it easy for applications to
have minimal UI in a platform specific way. It wraps the platform
specific calls required to show an icon in the system tray, as well as
add menu entries.

systray-rs is heavily influenced by
[the systray library for the Go Language](https://github.com/getlantern/systray).

systray-rs currently supports:

- Linux GTK
- Win32

Cocoa core still needed!
